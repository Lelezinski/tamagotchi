# Tigergotchi
A Tamagotchi running on the LandTiger v2 board for the CompArch Course 2023/24 Project. 

## The LandTiger

The LandTiger V2.0 NXP LPC1768 ARM development board is based on a second generation ARM Cortex-M3 microcontroller, a high-performance, low-power 32-bit microprocessor designed for embedded system applications, suitable for instrumentation, industrial communications, motor control, lighting control, alarm systems, and other fields.

The board supports USB2.0 Device and Host, dual CAN interfaces, RS-485 interface and an on-board USB emulator for JLINK.

## The Tamagotchi

Tamagotchi is a famous toy from the end of the ’90s and the beginning of the new millennium (but they still make them with genetics, NFC, and Bluetooth!). The goal of the game was to take care of a virtual pet, taking care of its basic needs, such as hunger and happiness. Of course, in the end, many kids just had tons of them on their consciences.

## The Tigergotchi!

The LandTiger board was emulated through Keil µVision to implement the Tamagotchi game. Finally, the full game was tested on the board itself after being flashed with the game code.
